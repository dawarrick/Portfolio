# Portfolio - Deb Warrick - https://debwarrick.com

### This portfolio represents my work experience, as well as the projects I'm doing as part of the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp.

#### It is pretty self-explanatory, so I will not repeat it here.

#### The portfolio includes some of my recent projects, as well as contact information.

#### It includes links to my Github, linkedIn profile, resume, and to project urls and github repositories.

#### The website is mobile responsive, making use of the Bootstrap Nav functionality for menu control and other features.

#### Using font-awesome and Google fonts for some new looks
